### Why use Git?
Git is a version control system that acts as a "safety net" for your project. Instead of saving multiple versions of a file (e.g., `analysis_v1`, `analysis_final_v2`), Git tracks every change made to your code. This allows you to:
* **Revert to previous versions** if a mistake is made.
* **Maintain a clear history** of how the project evolved.
* **Collaborate securely** without overwriting each other's work.

### GitHub & GitHub Desktop
To make this process as simple as possible, we will use **GitHub Desktop**. It provides a user-friendly visual interface, allowing you to manage your project without needing to learn complex command-line instructions.



### Getting Started
While you can manage files locally, it is highly recommended to **[create an account on GitHub.com](https://github.com/join)**. Having an account allows you to "publish" your repository to the cloud, ensuring your work is backed up and easily accessible for review or sharing.
