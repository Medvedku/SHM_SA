Why Spyder (brief):

- Familiar interface: editor + console + Variable Explorer — comfortable for researchers.
- Variable Explorer: view dataframes and arrays like a table (helps non-programmers).
- Integrated console and debugger: quick iterative exploration and simple troubleshooting.
- Scientific stack friendly: works well with `pandas`, `numpy`, and plotting libraries.

Spyder is a lightweight, user-friendly IDE that lowers the barrier to using Parquet files and Python for data inspection.
