# Welcome

This mini-showcase demonstrates a simple, practical workflow for working with Parquet files aimed at structural engineering researchers who prefer clear, hands-on steps.

What you'll find here:
- A quick environment setup to read/write Parquet files (`content/enviroment/_index.md`).
- A short Spyder-focused example showing how to open, inspect and save Parquet data (`content/spyder/_index.md`).

Goal: make Parquet files approachable — think of them as compact, fast spreadsheets you can load, inspect, filter, and save with a few lines of Python.

If you want, I can add a tiny sample Parquet dataset and a guided walkthrough (step-by-step) that your professor can run on his machine.
